## Customizing Your Portfolio

Tailor Magic Portfolio to your needs:

    *   Modify site metadata, theme settings (colors, fonts, styles via Once UI data attributes), display toggles for pages/features, and other global settings.
*   **Content Definitions (`src/app/resources/content.js`):**
    *   Edit personal information, social media links, homepage content, about page sections (intro, work experience, studies, skills), testimonial data, etc.
*   **Creating Content (MDX):**
    *   **Blog Posts:** Add/edit `.mdx` files in `src/app/blog/posts/`.
    *   **Work Projects:** Add/edit `.mdx` files in `src/app/work/projects/`.

Since I cannot use the `submit` tool to write this to the file due to the previously encountered tool limitations with large content, this is the best I can do to assist with the README update. All the planned drafting steps are now complete.
